## Asynchronous expressions

When an *expectation* needs to test something asynchronous, for instance testing
the result from a *promise*, the *expresion* will resolve as *undefined*. At this
point we don't know if the *expression* succeeded or failed; in order to know the
actual result we simply need to use the familiar Promise/A interface supported
by the *expression*.

```js
var req = $.get('http://pollinimini.net/person.json');
ass(req).resolves.plain.prop('name').eq('Iv√°n')
.then(function (result) {
  console.log('expression was ok!');
})
.catch(function (error) {
  ass.ok( error instanceof ass.Error );
  console.error(error);
});
```

Note that anytime we use `.then` (or `.catch`) it'll get automatically registered
with the expression, normally the chained properties only take effect when the
*expression* reaches that point while evaluating but `.then` is not an *expectation*,
it's part of the *expression* interface just like `.test` or `.assert`.

!!! caution
    We divert from the Promise/A specification in that callback functions
    registered with `.then` will be called **each and every time** the
    *expression* is resolved. The reasoning is that the `.then` is targeting
    the *expression*, which is an abstract form until it gets resolved.


### Testing Promises

By using `.resolves` and `.rejects` we can attach *expectations* to a promise
object, the *expression* will automatically enter the *async mode* and will
subscribe itself to the promise object using its `.then` method. Once the promise
is fulfilled (or rejected) the rest of the *expression* will continue resolving
now using the value transfered by the promise.
In other words, every *expectation* chained after `.resolves` or `.rejects` will
be only tested once the promise is resolved and will mutate the subject value to
be whatever the promise resolves to.

!!! hint
    When working with [Mocha](http://mochajs.org) or [Jasmine 2.x](http://jasmine.github.io)
    we are allowed to return a promise from a test and have it consumed before the
    test ends. Just return any *ass* expression to have it evaluated (even if it's not
    asynchronous).

```js
it('should fetch page asynchronously and test it', function () {
  var promise = $.get('http://google.com');
  return ass(promise).resolves.string.contains('<body>');
  // The test runner will wait here until promise is resolved and the
  // expression has completed.
});
```
