> Because **assert** and even **ass** were already taken!

**ass-ert** is a library of *composable* matchers offering a *fluent-ish* interface.

It tries to mix the best aspects of [Hamcrest](http://hamcrest.org/) with its
highly composable design, featuring beautifully descriptive messages, and the
easy on the eyes and the fingers of [chai](http://chaijs.com)'s fluent syntax
for defining assertions.

While the primary use case is testing it's by no means restricted to it, use
the matchers anywhere you may have a need for matching complex data structures
with ease.
